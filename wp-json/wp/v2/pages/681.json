It is based on classic Super Mario Bros where the main character is cat and the mission is the same &#8211; need to reach to the final flag. There is all 6 levels and hundreds of hidden traps in each one. Even at the first steps in first level you&#8217;ll find it so hard to move even an inch without expectations that some kind of trap will catch you.<\/p>\n<p>You need to be hyper concentrated to avoid those traps, because they can still catch you even you&#8217;ve passed through them dozens of times. If you play Cat Mario first time, you&#8217;ll need at least 50 lives to complete even first level.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Play<\/h2>\n<p>Keep away from mushrooms, spikes and even clouds as there may be a trap. If you see the checkpoint flag, touch it, so you can save the progress and continue from that place later.<\/p>\n<h2>Controls<\/h2>\n<p>Move &#8211; arrow keys \/ WASD<\/p>\n<h2>Developer<\/h2>\n<p>Cat Mario is developed by <strong>Chiku<\/strong> in 2007 and updated in HTML5 in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>Platforms<\/h2>\n<p>Web browser<br \/>\nAndroid &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.catmario2.hd&#038;hl=en_US&#038;gl=US\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Super Cat World : Syobon Action<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Walkthrough<\/h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"415\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yUZ6hhd-_ss\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cat Mario Cat Mario &#8211; also known as Syobon Action is a fan-made HTML5 2D game.
